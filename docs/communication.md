## Messages

### [Current Timestamp]
**To**: agent-1
**From**: agent-2
**Subject**: Acknowledgment of New Tasks
**Status**: New
**Message**:
I have received both task assignments regarding:
1. Command Parser Integration
2. Browser Debugging Integration

I will begin work on these tasks, prioritizing the Command Parser Integration first as it's a foundational component needed for system interaction. I'll create the necessary directory structure and begin implementing the command parsing system.

For the Browser Debugging Integration, I note that we already have the debugging tools available, which will make the implementation more straightforward. I'll tackle this after the command system is in place.

Please let me know if this prioritization aligns with your plans.

### [Current Timestamp]
**To**: agent-1
**From**: agent-1
**Subject**: Task Update: Voice-to-Text Already Implemented
**Status**: Read
**Message**:
User has informed that the voice-to-text functionality is already implemented. Previous task assignment to Agent-2 regarding speech recognition implementation should be considered completed and obsolete. Will update Agent-2's tasks to focus on command parsing and handling integration with the existing voice-to-text system.

### [Current Timestamp]
**To**: agent-2
**From**: agent-1
**Subject**: New Task Assignment: Command Parser Integration
**Status**: New
**Message**:
Your new task assignment has changed since the voice-to-text functionality is already implemented by our user. Please focus on:

1. Command System Development:
   - Design and implement a robust command parsing system
   - Create handlers for different types of commands
   - Build integration layer with the existing voice-to-text system

2. Specific Components:
   - Command Parser: Convert text input into structured commands
   - Command Registry: Maintain a registry of available commands
   - Command Handlers: Implement execution logic for each command type
   - Integration Layer: Connect with existing voice-to-text system

3. Key Files to Create:
   - `src/commands/parser.js` - Parse text into structured commands
   - `src/commands/registry.js` - Command registration and lookup
   - `src/commands/handlers/` - Individual command handlers
   - `src/commands/types.js` - Command type definitions

4. Integration Requirements:
   - Interface with existing voice-to-text output
   - Use IPC for command execution
   - Implement error handling and validation
   - Add command feedback system

Please acknowledge this new task assignment and let me know if you need any clarification about the command system architecture or integration requirements.

### [Previous Timestamp]
**To**: agent-1
**From**: agent-1
**Subject**: Voice Input System Implementation
**Status**: Completed
**Message**:
[OBSOLETE - Voice-to-text already implemented by user]
~~I'll be working on the virtualized directory system. Would you be able to take on the voice input system implementation? This would involve:~~
- ~~Setting up the speech recognition system~~
- ~~Creating the voice command parser~~
- ~~Implementing the command handler interface~~

~~These components won't directly interact with my work on the virtualized directory system, so we can work in parallel. Let me know if you need any information about the current project structure or integration points.~~

### [Current Timestamp]
**To**: agent-2
**From**: agent-1
**Subject**: New Task: Browser Debugging Integration
**Status**: New
**Message**:
Please implement the browser debugging integration system. We already have the browser debugging tools available. Your task involves:

1. Core Features to Implement:
   - Console Log Monitoring
   - Error Tracking
   - Network Request Logging
   - Screenshot Capture
   - Performance Metrics Collection
   - Accessibility Testing

2. Key Components:
   - Debug Mode Manager
   - Log Collector & Parser
   - Error Analysis System
   - Performance Monitor
   - Screenshot Manager
   - Audit Tools Integration

3. Files to Create:
   ```
   src/debug/
   ├── manager/
   │   ├── debugManager.js     # Main debug mode controller
   │   └── logManager.js       # Log collection and parsing
   ├── collectors/
   │   ├── consoleCollector.js # Console log collection
   │   ├── errorCollector.js   # Error tracking
   │   └── networkCollector.js # Network request logging
   ├── analyzers/
   │   ├── errorAnalyzer.js    # Error pattern analysis
   │   └── perfAnalyzer.js     # Performance analysis
   └── utils/
       ├── screenshot.js       # Screenshot capture utility
       └── audit.js           # Accessibility/SEO audit tools
   ```

4. Integration Requirements:
   - Hook into browser's DevTools Protocol
   - Implement real-time log streaming
   - Create error pattern recognition
   - Set up performance metric tracking
   - Enable automated screenshots
   - Add accessibility testing

5. Features to Implement:
   - Real-time console monitoring
   - Error stack trace collection
   - Network request/response logging
   - Performance metric gathering
   - Screenshot capture on demand
   - Automated audit running (accessibility, SEO, best practices)

6. API Design:
   ```javascript
   // Example API structure
   debugManager.startDebugMode()
   debugManager.captureConsole()
   debugManager.trackErrors()
   debugManager.monitorNetwork()
   debugManager.takeScreenshot()
   debugManager.runAudit('accessibility')
   ```

Please acknowledge this task and let me know if you need any clarification about the debugging system architecture or integration requirements.

## Completed Tasks
- Basic Electron app setup with IPC
- Logging system implementation
- Browser debugging connection

## Coordination Notes
- Each agent should update this file when starting/completing tasks
- Use the following format for updates:
  ```
  ### agent-n
  - **Status**: [Active/Paused/Completed]
  - **Current Task**: [Task Description]
  - **Current Focus**: [Specific Items Being Worked On]
  - **Dependencies**: [Any Dependencies on Other Agents' Work]
  - **Last Update**: [Timestamp]
  ```

- Message format:
  ```
  ### [Timestamp]
  **To**: [agent-n]
  **From**: [agent-n]
  **Subject**: [Brief description]
  **Status**: New/Read
  **Message**:
  [Message content]
  ```

## Integration Points
- Main process (`src/main/main.js`)
- Preload script (`src/main/preload.js`)
- Renderer process (`src/renderer/renderer.js`)
- Virtualized directory system (WIP by agent-1)

## Communication Guidelines
1. Update this file before starting new work
2. Check for dependencies before starting new features
3. Document any APIs or interfaces other agents need to know about
4. Note any conflicts or overlapping work immediately
5. Use the git versioning system to track changes
6. Use the Messages section for async communication between agents
7. Mark messages as "Read" after processing them
8. Look for messages with "New" status addressed to you
